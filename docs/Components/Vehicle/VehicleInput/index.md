# Vehicle Input

## Simulated Autoware override input

### Overview

Autoware accepts manual steering and pedal control by the driver during Autonomus Driving. This allows the driver to shift from Autoware's Autonomous driving to Driver's Manual driving.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    AUTONOMOUS --> MANUAL : override input
    MANUAL --> AUTONOMOUS : restart autonomous driving
```

Q. How to override input ?  
A. Control steering and pedals with any device.

Q. How to restart autonomous driving ?  
A. The control mode can be changed by `input/control_mode_request` ros2 service communication.  

!!! info
    
    sample engage command.  
    ```ros2 service call input/control_mode_request autoware_vehicle_msgs/srv/ControlModeCommand "mode: 1"```

    The following modes are supported.  
    AUTONOMOUS = 1  
    MANUAL = 4


In the real world, Autoware switches modes by publishing **ControlMode(AUTONOMOUS or MANUAL)** from the vehicle, and AWSIM simulates this as well. Current ControlMode can be checked from the AWSIM UI.


|AUTONOMOUS|MANUAL|

ControlMode at AWSIM start is AUTONOMOUS.

#### How to setup Logitech G29

1. Connect the Logitech G29 to your PC
1. Check the device path for G29. For example, use the `$ evtest` command to get a path such as `/dev/input/event*`
1. Apply G29 device path to AWSIM. If you run `AutowareSimulation.unity` in the demo player (AWSIM.x86_64) or UnityEditor, it is configurable in JSON.  
Set the path to G29DevicePath in [config.json](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM/blob/main/Assets/AWSIM/Scenes/Main/AutowareSimulation/config.json). e.g. `"G29DevicePath": "/dev/input/event8`

1. Start AWSIM and select Logitech G29 from the UI. If "connected" is displayed, the vehicle can be controlled by Logitech g29.

!!! warning
    
    Steering wheel must be set to center before driving.

#### Advanced configuration
